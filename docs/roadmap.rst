Roadmap
=======
The planned features and improvements for **Zyntex**.
Priorities indicate the rough order of importance, but timelines are not fixed.

Planned Features
----------------

- **Low priority**

  - Expose API for providing node locations.
  - Add support for parsing lower-level elements (e.g. function and test bodies).
  - Support for parsing .zon files.
  - Add a second example that uses parsing and code generation.

- **Medium priority**

  - Expose comment inspection API.
  - Add support for additional CPU architectures.

- **High priority**

  - Full support for zig types (currently, an AssertionError is raised for more complex types).
