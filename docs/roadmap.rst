Roadmap
=======
The planned features and improvements for **Zyntex**.
Priorities indicate the rough order of importance, but timelines are not fixed.

Planned Features
----------------

- **Low priority**

  - Add support for additional CPU architectures.
  - Add support for parsing lower-level elements (e.g. function and test bodies).

- **Medium priority**

  - Update Zig parser backend to track the latest stable Zig version
    (Currently, we're one version behind).
  - Add support to comptime elements parsing (e.g. comptime variable).

- **High priority**
