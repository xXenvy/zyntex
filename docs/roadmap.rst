Roadmap
=======
The planned features and improvements for **Zyntex**.
Priorities indicate the rough order of importance, but timelines are not fixed.

Planned Features

- **Low priority**

  - Add support for additional CPU architectures.

- **Medium priority**

  - Update Zig parser backend to track the latest stable Zig version
    (Currently, we're one version behind).

- **High priority**

  - Add support for generating Zig code from Python objects.
